# SchoolProject
This is a project for my CSCI class. If anyone has any ways for me to imporve the code. Please feel free to write some comments on how i can imporve it.

/*
 * In phase I we will be implementing R1, R2, R9,R10, R11, and R12. Use two vector as data structure.
 * One for creating a list of actors-actress and one for creating a list of pictures.
 * In this phase we will create the following classes
 *
 *      Class for actor-actress
        Class for pictures
        Class for database. This class will contain the main function and functions required to perform the
        actions required for implemented requirements.
 *
 * Main method will use the menu function to display following menu and ask user to select a menu item:
 *          R1 – Read in actors-actress data file and add them to actors-actress list.
            R2 – Read in pictures data file and add them to pictures list.
            R9 – Save the actors-actress list into a csv file.
            R10 – Save pictures list into a csv file.
            R11 – Display list of actors-actress on screen.
            R12 – Display list of pictures on screen.

Notes:
Each of the above requirements will be implemented in its own function.

User will select the menu item in menu function and menu function will call an appropriate function.

For R1, R2, R10, and R11 you will prompt user for the file name.

The first line of a csv file lists the name of the fields separated with commas,
 ending in a newline. Then the following lines are the information from the fields separated with commas,
 ending in a newline.
 */

//it will iterate through all the lines in a file and put them in a given vector

/*Notes:
Phase 2
R3: You will ask for the required information (Year, Award, Winner, Name, Film),
        create a new actors-actress object and add it to the actors-actress vector.
R4: You will ask for the required information (name, year, nominations, rating, duration,
        genre1, genre2, release, metacritic, synopsis), create a new pictures object
        and add it to the pictures vector.
